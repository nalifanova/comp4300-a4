# Assignment 04 for COMP 4300 Course

--------------------------------------

## Program Specification

In this assignment you will be writing the game that was presented in class.
This game must have the following features:

### Assets: 
- Entities in the game will be rendered using various Textures and Animations
  which we will be calling Assets (along with Fonts and Sounds)
- Assets are loaded once at the beginning of the program and stored in the
  Assets class, which is stored by the GameEngine class
- All Assets are defined in assets.txt, with the syntax defined below

### Player:
- The player Entity in the game is represented by NotLink, which has several
  different Animations: RunDown, RunUp, RunRight, StandDown, StandUp,
  StandRight, AtkUp, AtkDown, AtkRight. You must determine which direction
  and state the player is currently in and assign the correct Animation.
- The Player is assigned the following animations in the direction facing.
  Please note that Left will be accomplished by mirroring Right (x scale -1)
  StandDir  - When no input (or both opposite) is being given to the player
  RunDir    - When move input is given to the player in a direction
  AttackDir - When the player's sword is currently visible from an attack
- The player moves with the following controls:
  Left: A, Right: D, Up: W, Down: S, Attack: Space Key
- The player can move up, left, down, right, at any time during the game.
- The player can only move either horizontally or vertically at a given time
- If opposite directions are held, the player will be given a Stand animation
- The player can only attack once its current attack animation has finished.
- The player collides with 'Tile' entities in the level (see level syntax)
  whose bounding box blocks movements and cannot move through them.
- The player will be given a CBoundBox of a size specified in the level file
- The player will be given a CHealth component with a max health that is
  specified in the level file
- When the player's current health is <= 0, the player respawns, and the
  LinkDie sound should play
- If the player has a CInvincibility component, it takes no damage from
  enemies and its sprite is made transparent. The duration of the component
  is reduced each frame, and when the duration reaches 0, the component is
  removed, making it vulnerable to attacks again.
- When the player collides with an enemy while not invincible:
  - player's current health is reduced by the enemy damage component
  - the LinkHit sound should player (Note: respawn place is an initial
    position of a player in a level)
  - player has a CInvincibility component which lasts for 30 frames

### Other Entities:
- Each tile and NPC in the game specifies two boolean values of whether
  it blocks movement and whether it blocks vision. If a tile blocks movement,
  the player collides with it and cannot pass through. If an entity blocks
  vision then it affects enemy line of sight. See spec below.
- CBoundBox has two new booleans to reflect these changes
- When the player steps onto a tile with the "Black" animation, they
  are teleported to a random "Black" tile on the map

### Attacking:
- When the player attacks, a sword appears for 10 frames and then disappears
  approximately 1 tile away from the player in the direction they are facing.
- The player's sword should be given a bounding box equal to the animation size
- When the sword collides with an enemy, it deals its damage component worth
  of damage to the health of the enemy that it collides with. The sword should
  only do damage for one frame, and then its damage component should be
  removed so that it does not deal damage for every frame it overlaps.
- When the sword is swung, the Slash sound should play
- When the sword collides with an enemy, the EnemyHit sound should play
- When an enemy's health is reduced to 0, it is destroyed
- When an enemy is destroyed, the EnemyDie sound should be play

### NPC Entities:
- NPC entities will each be given an 'ai' behavior in the level file, either
  'Follow' or 'Patrol'.
- 'Follow' means it will follow the player when the player is direct line of
  sight, or head back to its original position when not in line of sight.
  When an entity is at his home position, it should not oscillate.
- 'Patrol' means it will move toward a series of patrol positions, looping
  back around to the start when the final one is reached. An NPC has reached
  its patrol position if it is within a distance of 5 from it. (Note: the
  speed of the entity shouldn't be higher than the distance)

### Tiles:
- Tiles are Entities that define the level geometry and interact with players
- Tiles can be given any Animation that is defined in the Assets file
- Tiles will be given a CBoundingBox equal to the size of the animation:
  tile->get<CAnimation>().animation.getSize()
- The current animation displayed for a tile can be retrieved with:
  tile->get<CAnimation>().animation.getName()
- If a tile is given the Heart animation, any NPC that collides with it
  should have its health filed to maximum, and the tile is destroyed.

#### Drawing:
- The game window is given a fixed size of 1280x768 pixels (20x12 tiles)
- Rendering of entities is provided for you, as well as a 'debug' rendering
  mode which can be toggled with the 'C' key, and the 'T' key toggling
  texture rendering.
- You are required to change the camera position (window.view()) of the game
  window to alternate between two modes based on the m_follow variable:
  true:  Follow Mode - the camera is always centered on NotLink
  false: Room Mode   - the camera is centered in the middle of the room

### Rooms:
- Each level is split up into individual 'room' given a (rx,ry) coordinate
- Room (rx,ry) is defined by the rectangle (rx*w, ry*h, w, h) where w and h
  are the window width and height respectively.
- Each tile is given a (tx,ty) grid position within a room. By default, the
  grid cells and all tiles have size 64x64 pixels
- When NotLink moves to a new room, the camera should center to that room

### GUI:
- You must implement the "Animations" and "EntityManager" tabs in ImGui
  so that they have the same functionality as the solution.

### Misc:
- The 'P' key should pause the game
- The 'C' key toggles debugging view
- The 'T' key toggles textures rendering
- The 'G' key toggles drawing the grid
- The 'Y' key should toggle between follow camera or 'room' camera
- The 'ESC' key should go 'back' to the Main Menu, or quit if on the Main Menu

- This NPC does not block movement or vision
- This NPC has a Patrol AI with speed 2 and 4 positions, each in room (0,0)
  Positions: (15,10) (15,7) (17,7) (17,10)
  ```

--------------------------------------

## Misc Notes

1. The m_player variable has been removed and replaced with the player()
   function, which looks in the EntityManager for a player and returns it.
   This is slightly less efficient, but allows us to put in sanity checks for
   things like checking to see if a player object exists before using it, etc.

2. Entity getComponent, addComponent, etc. have been shorted to get, add, etc.
   Example: e->getComponent<CTransform> is now e->get<CTransform>()

3. sf::Sound objects can be played with .play() and stopped with .stop().
   However in order to play, the Sound object must persist for at least the
   duration of the sound that you want to be played. If you simply allocate a
   local Sound object and then call sound.play(), it will stop playing as soon
   as the Sound object goes out of scope. Calling sound.play() on a Sound
   object that is already playing will restart the sound, not start playing
   another one.


--------------------------------------

## Assignment Hints

You can use all of your collision code from Assignment 3 in this assignment.

I recommend approaching this assignment in the following order:

[0] Implement the GUI whenever you feel you'd like to have it for debugging
1. Implement WASD movement for the player such that it moves u/l/d/r when
   those keys are pressed. This will allow you to test rectangular collisions
   as soon as possible
2. Implement Scene_Zelda::loadLevel(), which will allow you to load the assets
   for the level given to you to test the rest of the assignment. To do this,
   you will need to implement getPosition()
3. Implement spawnPlayer() so that it correctly uses the configuration
   specified by the level file, so you can start testing collisions
4. Implement the camera changes described above
5. Implement spawnSword() so that it spawns a sword in the correct position
   with the correct lifespan
6. Implement player attacking / sword collision with NPCs / health / damage
7. Implement player animation to correctly animate based on player state
8. Implement NPC Patrol behavior
   Implement NPC Follow behavior without vision
9. Implement Physics::LineIntersect() which will allow you to test whether or
   not two line segments AB and CD intersect, and where they intersect
10. Implement Physics::EntityIntersect() which will allow you to test whether
    line segment AB intersects with any lines of the bounding box of Entity
11. Implement NPC Follow behavior using 10 to check line of sight
12. Implement invincibility frames
13. Implement heart pickups
14. Implement black tile teleporting

### Notes

8 of 14 should be implemented as minimum
